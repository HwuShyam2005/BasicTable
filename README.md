# HTML 
I have just coded a basic webpage in which it consist of a code for creating a table.
Hope it helps you

=>On 13th June 2024
created website and added a table with columns 
#Name 
#Contact 
#Country

=>On 14th June 2024
created a simple form consisting of the following 
#Name
#Contact No.
#DOB
#Address
#Username 
#Password
here, the password works in a similar way how a normal website works and also has the visible password option too 
the DOB works in the format of how we can navigate through each year , month and date similar to a calendar
