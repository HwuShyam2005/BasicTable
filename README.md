# HTML 
I have just coded a basic webpage in which it consist of a code for creating a table.
Hope it helps you

=>On 13th June 2024
created website and added a table with columns Name, Contact and Country.
here,we can see the column names are in bold as we us <th> which is title header.   

=>On 14th June 2024
created a simple form consisting of Name, Contact No., DOB, Address, Username and Password.
here, the password works in a similar way how a normal website works and also has the visible password option too 
the DOB works in the format of how we can navigate through each year , month and date similar to a calendar
